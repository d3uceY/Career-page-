										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>L-R: Assistant Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing, Dana Pharmaceuticals Limited, Mr. Gerald Oputa; Secretary to the State Government, Mrs. Folashade Jaji; Country Head, Dana Pharmaceuticals Limited, Mr. Bharat Vaswani; Permanent Secretary, Cabinet Office, Lagos State, Mrs. Kemi Durosinmi-Etti; and Director, Administration, and Human Resources, Mrs. Iyabode Akinsanya, during the presentation of essential drugs to Lagos State Government by DANA Pharmaceuticals Limited in Lagos recently.</p></blockquote>
<p>To bolster the efforts of the Lagos State Government, Dana Pharmaceuticals Ltd has donated essential drugs for the provision of treatment to people who contracted the virus in the State. Recognising that a rapid demand spike for medications was likely to be occasioned by the spread of the virus, Dana Pharmaceuticals donated the drugs to the State Government to complement their efforts on getting ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />
Lagos is the epicentre of the spread in Nigeria and the donation of the drugs to the state would help alleviate concerns that the wave of the spread of Covid-19 will over-stretch the capacities of the health institutions and the availability of medication for the people.</p>
<p>Dana Pharmaceuticals as one of the foremost infusions and a drug manufacturing company in Nigeria is reputed for responding to health needs on the ground as they evolve, while simultaneously manufacturing essential drugs. They’ve initiated life-saving interventions and supports to governments and communities across the country, particularly in this pandemic. Focusing on holistic sustainable solutions, the company partners with the government and other organisations to build systems that better prepare communities for crisis and prevent the effects of the devastation on the most vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Among the drugs donated include Paracetamol tablets, X-Pel Cough Suspension Syrups, and Chloroquine Phosphate tablets amongst others for possible use in treating patients hospitalised with COVID-19. “Governor Sanwo-Olu is taking every possible step to protect the people from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,” said Bharat Vaswani, Country Head for Dana Pharmaceuticals. “As a corporate citizen and Nigeria’s foremost pharmaceutical company it’s only natural for us to partner the government in the fight against COVID-19 and providing safety net from the adverse effects of the virus. The Governor’s bold leadership and the hard work of the Ministry of Health have continued to spur us on in contributing our quota to the fight against this pandemic. We’ll continue working around the clock to provide drugs and partner with institutions to give access to patients to help them battle COVID-19 while continuing our commitment to manufacturing drugs to provide succour to the people in this new normal.</p>
<p>Given the importance of drug donation by Dana Pharmaceuticals for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, the Lagos State Health Ministry, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the selfless services of all medical personnel, are working together to help provide treatments for the patients in the isolation centres across the state. The use of the donated medications is expected to help ease supply pressures for drugs, and Dana Pharmaceuticals, being at the vanguard partnering the state government is also working to increase production to ensure these drugs also remain available for patients dependent on them for the treatment of other ailments.</p>
<p>Dana Pharmaceuticals works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Nigerians, providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services. The company is committed to saving lives and protect Nigerians with the production of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in hospitals and local supplies in a public health emergency. The existing pharma product range includes formulations, infusions, and medical consumables produced by Dana Pharmaceuticals and reputable partners in overseas pharmaceutical companies.</p>
