Recognising that a rapid demand spike for medications was likely to be occasioned by the spread of the virus, Dana Pharmaceuticals donated the drugs to the State Government to complement their efforts on getting ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br \/>\nLagos is the epicentre of the spread in Nigeria and the donation of the drugs to the state would help alleviate concerns that the wave of the spread of Covid-19 will over-stretch the capacities of the health institutions and the availability of medication for the people.<\/p>\n<p>Dana Pharmaceuticals as one of the foremost infusions and a drug manufacturing company in Nigeria is reputed for responding to health needs on the ground as they evolve, while simultaneously manufacturing essential drugs.

We\u2019ll continue working around the clock to provide drugs and partner with institutions to give access to patients to help them battle COVID-19 while continuing our commitment to manufacturing drugs to provide succour to the people in this new normal.<\/p>\n<p>Given the importance of drug donation by Dana Pharmaceuticals for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, the Lagos State Health Ministry, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the selfless services of all medical personnel, are working together to help provide treatments for the patients in the isolation centres across the state. The use of the donated medications is expected to help ease supply pressures for drugs, and Dana Pharmaceuticals, being at the vanguard partnering the state government is also working to increase production to ensure these drugs also remain available for patients dependent on them for the treatment of other ailments.<\/p>\n<p>Dana Pharmaceuticals works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Nigerians, providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services.
